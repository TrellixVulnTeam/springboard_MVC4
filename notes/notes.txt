Linear Regression Assumptions
Linearity: The relationship between X and the mean of Y is linear.
Homoscedasticity: The variance of residual is the same for any value of X.
Independence: Observations are independent of each other.
Normality: For any fixed value of X, Y is normally distributed.


Classificaiton Descriptions:

Naive Bayes:
Classificaiton algorithm based on Bayes's Theorem which gives an assumption of independence among predictors. In simple terms, a Naive Bayes classifier assumes that the presence of a feature in a class is unrelated to the presence of any other feature
Pros: Fast, small amount of data needed
Cons: bad estimator

K Nearest Neighbors:
Gives a classification based on classification of other neighbors 


Decision Tree:
Builds classification model in a tree structure. 
Categorical and numerical
Simplicity to understand and visualize
Quite unstable because a change in data can change the entire decision tree

Random Forrest:
Many decision trees, can give average of multiple trees.
More accurate than decision tree
Quite complex in implementation and slow in real time prediction

ANN:
Poor inte

SVM:
classifier that represents training data in poitns in space and then 

Uses a subset of data, which makes it memory efficient and is good with high dimensial space
does not give probability estimates

Questions for today:
Best practice to put env in gitignore?
Common practice to do gridsearch with all classifiers?
